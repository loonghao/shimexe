# GitHub Actions & Release Automation Setup Guide

This document explains how to configure GitHub Actions permissions and automated release tools for the shimexe project.

## üö® Critical Permission Issues

If you encounter these errors:

```
GitHub Actions is not permitted to create or approve pull requests.
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

```
remote: Permission to git denied to github-actions[bot].
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/...': The requested URL returned error: 403
```

This means GitHub Actions doesn't have sufficient permissions in your repository.

## üîß Release Tools in This Project

We use **TWO** release automation tools:

1. **release-please** - Google's general-purpose release tool
2. **release-plz** - Rust-specific release tool

Both tools can create PRs, so they need proper permissions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Complete Solution (3 Steps Required)

### Step 1: Repository Settings (CRITICAL)

**You MUST enable this setting for any release automation to work:**

1. Go to your repository **Settings**
2. Navigate to **Actions** ‚Üí **General**
3. Scroll down to **Workflow permissions**
4. Select **"Read and write permissions"**
5. ‚úÖ **Enable "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"**
6. Click **Save**

**Without this setting, ALL release tools will fail with 403 errors.**

### Step 2: Personal Access Tokens (RECOMMENDED)

Even with repository settings enabled, using Personal Access Tokens provides better reliability:

#### For release-please:
1. **Create a Personal Access Token:**
   - Go to GitHub Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens ‚Üí Tokens (classic)
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Name: "Release Please Token"
   - Expiration: Choose appropriate duration
   - Select these scopes:
     - ‚úÖ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
     - ‚úÖ `workflow` (Update GitHub Action workflows)
     - ‚úÖ `write:packages` (Upload packages to GitHub Package Registry)

2. **Add as repository secret:**
   - Repository Settings ‚Üí **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
   - Click **New repository secret**
   - Name: `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN`
   - Value: Your PAT
   - Click **Add secret**

#### For release-plz:
1. **Create another PAT** (or reuse the same one):
   - Same scopes as above
2. **Add as repository secret:**
   - Name: `RELEASE_PLZ_TOKEN`
   - Value: Your PAT

### Step 3: Verify All Secrets

Ensure you have these secrets configured:
- ‚úÖ `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN` (for release-please)
- ‚úÖ `RELEASE_PLZ_TOKEN` (for release-plz)
- ‚úÖ `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` (for crates.io publishing)
- ‚úÖ `CHOCOLATEY_API_KEY` (for Chocolatey publishing)

## üîê Workflow Permissions Explained

All workflows now have explicit permissions configured:

### CI Workflow (`ci.yml`)
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read        # Read repository contents
  actions: read         # Read workflow status
  security-events: write # Write security audit results
```

### Release Please (`release-please.yml`)
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write           # Create releases and tags
  pull-requests: write      # Create and update PRs
  issues: write            # Create and update issues
  repository-projects: write # Update project boards
```

### Release PLZ (`release-plz.yml`)
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write           # Create releases and tags
  pull-requests: write      # Create and update PRs
  issues: write            # Create and update issues
  repository-projects: write # Update project boards
```

### Release Build (`release.yml`)
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write    # Upload release assets
  actions: read      # Read workflow status
  id-token: write    # For OIDC authentication
```

## üöÄ How Release Automation Works

1. **Commit Analysis**: Release-please analyzes commit messages following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
2. **Version Bumping**: Based on commit types, it determines the appropriate version bump:
   - `feat:` ‚Üí Minor version bump (0.1.0 ‚Üí 0.2.0)
   - `fix:` ‚Üí Patch version bump (0.1.0 ‚Üí 0.1.1)
   - `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` ‚Üí Major version bump (0.1.0 ‚Üí 1.0.0)
3. **Release PR Creation**: Creates a PR with updated versions and changelog
4. **Release Creation**: When the PR is merged, creates a GitHub release

## Conventional Commit Examples

```bash
# Feature (minor version bump)
git commit -m "feat: add new shim configuration option"

# Bug fix (patch version bump)
git commit -m "fix: resolve path resolution issue on Windows"

# Breaking change (major version bump)
git commit -m "feat!: change configuration file format"
# or
git commit -m "feat: change configuration file format

BREAKING CHANGE: Configuration files now use YAML instead of TOML"

# Other types (no version bump)
git commit -m "docs: update README with new examples"
git commit -m "chore: update dependencies"
git commit -m "ci: improve release workflow"
```

## Workspace Configuration

Our project uses a Rust workspace with two crates:
- `crates/shimexe-cli` (package: `shimexe`) - The CLI tool
- `crates/shimexe-core` (package: `shimexe-core`) - The core library

Release-please will:
- Track versions independently for each crate
- Create separate changelog entries
- Release both crates when their versions change

## üîç Troubleshooting Guide

### 403 Permission Errors

**Error**: `GitHub Actions is not permitted to create or approve pull requests`

**Solutions** (try in order):
1. ‚úÖ Enable "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" in repository settings
2. ‚úÖ Verify workflow permissions are correctly set
3. ‚úÖ Create and configure Personal Access Tokens
4. ‚úÖ Check that PAT has correct scopes (`repo`, `workflow`, `write:packages`)
5. ‚úÖ Ensure PAT hasn't expired

### Token Authentication Issues

**Error**: `remote: Permission to git denied to github-actions[bot]`

**Solutions**:
1. Use Personal Access Token instead of `GITHUB_TOKEN`
2. Verify token has `repo` scope
3. Check token expiration date
4. Ensure token is added as correct secret name

### Workflow Conflicts

**Problem**: Both release-please and release-plz running simultaneously

**Solutions**:
1. **Recommended**: Use only one release tool
2. **Alternative**: Configure different trigger conditions
3. **Current setup**: Both tools use different tokens to avoid conflicts

### "is not a package manifest" Error
This usually means the workspace configuration is incorrect. Ensure:
- `Cargo.toml` has proper `[workspace]` section
- Each crate has a valid `Cargo.toml`
- Paths in `.release-please-manifest.json` match actual crate directories

### No Release PR Created
Release tools only create PRs when they detect commits that should trigger a release:
- Make sure you're using conventional commit messages
- Check that commits are on the `main` branch
- Verify the workflow has proper permissions
- Check workflow logs for detailed error messages

### Multiple Releases
If you want to release only specific crates, you can:
- Use path-based commit prefixes: `feat(shimexe-core): add new feature`
- Manually edit the release PR to exclude certain crates

### Debugging Steps

1. **Check workflow logs** in Actions tab
2. **Verify repository settings** are correct
3. **Test with a simple conventional commit**
4. **Check secret configuration**
5. **Verify token permissions and expiration**

## Manual Release

If you need to create a release manually:

1. Update version in `Cargo.toml` files
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` files
3. Commit changes with conventional commit message
4. Create and merge PR
5. Release-please will detect the version change and create a release
